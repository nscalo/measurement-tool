## Measurement Tool to Track the Requirements

**Subject Areas used here are:**

- Machine Learning

    Machine Learning is used to statistically infer results that are metrics or relevant benchmarking details.

- Requirements Engineering

    The final product gives a provision to do prototyping, retrospective and perform risk analysis.

- Project Management

    The outcome of the use of this tool is to generate a Mandate and then analyse feasibility of the intended solution.

- Web Development

    Python Flask servers make it easy for the developer to record the observations which further improves process of delivery.

- Computer Vision

    Computer Vision is used with video and images to receive maximum feedback from the client on finding the purpose of the project outcomes.

## Stages of Development of Requirements

The stages are listed on 7 stages:

- Project Blastoff

    The blastoff stage includes the discussion of stakeholder needs wihin major listed stakeholder groups. The blastoff happening in 1 or 2 sessions, are essential for getting a basic understanding of the project. A project that requires statistical significance must undergo a preliminary analysis on the obtained sample of the dataset.

- Trawl for Knowledge

    In the knowledge gathering sessions such as client workshops, interviews, inference from obtained results and documentation of existing methodologies the conceptual knowledge of the requirements are recorded. 

- Write the Requirements

    The inferences are represented as APIs in terms of functional and non-functional requirements with ocl based attribute matching and go-nogo decisions. In an ocl setting, **kwargs, state of an object or data whether it is new, unique or any are recorded.

- Quality Gateway

    The tunable parameters, change of state of objects are visualized using a tree. The completeness of the tree and the relevance of the attributes are measured. 

- Prototype the Requirements

    This is the stage where sample screenshots are given to the user to view the use cases of the application. 

- Do Requirements Retrospective

    A retrospective is recorded in a tabular form to maintain a register of what is wrong or what is right. Retrospectives are written as text input and right / wrong are marked against them.

- Taking the stock of specification

    Requirements content, requirements interaction and config are recorded in a tabular form. The content comes from API requests and the config comes from Python decorators. Interactions of requirements are manually entered. 

    Additional tables of risk register, containing ordered list of APIs and their features are listed within, the other tables include review list that include the list of APIs that need revisiting and ratings list that include satisfaction and dissatisfaction ratings.
